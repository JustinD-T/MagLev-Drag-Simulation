# MagLev-Drag-Simulation
A program created for my Gr.11 physics culminating task. The program uses test results like the displacement of a marble from an inclined MagLev plane, to derive the frictive difference between magnitized and non-magnitized systems.

The full mathematical and programming breakdown can be accessed through both word files uploaded.

The document entitled ' The Derivation of Kinetic Friction Force Differentials with Kinematic Formulae. ' includes the program's output table and the mathematics used to derive frictive differences.
